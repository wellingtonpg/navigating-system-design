# Instagram
### Let's design a photo-sharing service like Instagram, where users can upload photos to share them with other users.

Similar Services: Flickr, Picasa

Difficulty Level: Medium

## 1. What is Instagram?
Instagram is a social networking service which enables its users to upload and share their photos and videos with other users. Instagram users can choose to share information either publicly or privately. Anything shared publicly can be seen by any other user, whereas privately shared content can only be accessed by a specified set of people. Instagram also enables its users to share through many other social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.

For the sake of this exercise, we plan to design a simpler version of Instagram, where a user can share photos and can also follow other users. The â€˜News Feedâ€™ for each user will consist of top photos of all the people the user follows.

## 2. Requirements and Goals of the System
Weâ€™ll focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Instagram:

### Functional Requirements
1. Users should be able to upload/download/view photos.
2. Users can perform searches based on photo/video titles.
3. Users can follow other users.
4. The system should be able to generate and display a userâ€™s News Feed consisting of top photos from all the people the user follows.

### Non-functional Requirements
1. Our service needs to be highly available.
2. The acceptable latency of the system is 200ms for News Feed generation.
3. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability), if a user doesnâ€™t see a photo for a while; it should be fine.
4. The system should be highly reliable; any uploaded photo or video should never be lost.

**Not in scope:** Adding tags to photos, searching photos on tags, commenting on photos, tagging users to photos, who to follow, etc.

## 3. Some Design Considerations
The system would be read-heavy, so we will focus on building a system that can retrieve photos quickly.

1. Practically, users can upload as many photos as they like. Efficient management of storage should be a crucial factor while designing this system.
2. Low latency is expected while viewing photos.
3. Data should be 100% reliable. If a user uploads a photo, the system will guarantee that it will never be lost.

## 4. Capacity Estimation and Constraints
* Letâ€™s assume we have 500M total users, with 1M daily active users.
* 2M new photos every day, 23 new photos every second.
* Average photo file size => 200KB
* Total space required for 1 day of photos
#### <div align="center">2M * 200KB => 400 GB</div>
* Total space required for 10 years:
  #### <div align="center">400GB * 365 (days a year) * 10 (years) ~= 1425TB</div>

## 5. High Level System Design
At a high-level, we need to support two scenarios, one to upload photos and the other to view/search photos. Our service would need some [object storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) servers to store photos and also some database servers to store metadata information about the photos.

## 6. Database Schema
### ðŸ’¡Defining the DB schema in the early stages of the interview would help to understand the data flow among various components and later would guide towards data partitioning.
We need to store data about users, their uploaded photos, and people they follow. Photo table will store all data related to a photo; we need to have an index on (PhotoID, CreationDate) since we need to fetch recent photos first.

A straightforward approach for storing the above schema would be to use an RDBMS like MySQL since we require joins. But relational databases come with their challenges, especially when we need to scale them. For details, please take a look at [SQL vs. NoSQL](../basics/sql-vs-nosql.md).

We can store photos in a distributed file storage like [HDFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop) or [S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3).

We can store the above schema in a distributed key-value store to enjoy the benefits offered by NoSQL. All the metadata related to photos can go to a table where the â€˜keyâ€™ would be the â€˜PhotoIDâ€™ and the â€˜valueâ€™ would be an object containing PhotoLocation, UserLocation, CreationTimestamp, etc.

We need to store relationships between users and photos, to know who owns which photo. We also need to store the list of people a user follows. For both of these tables, we can use a wide-column datastore like [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra). For the â€˜UserPhotoâ€™ table, the â€˜keyâ€™ would be â€˜UserIDâ€™ and the â€˜valueâ€™ would be the list of â€˜PhotoIDsâ€™ the user owns, stored in different columns. We will have a similar scheme for the â€˜UserFollowâ€™ table.

Cassandra or key-value stores in general, always maintain a certain number of replicas to offer reliability. Also, in such data stores, deletes donâ€™t get applied instantly, data is retained for certain days (to support undeleting) before getting removed from the system permanently.
